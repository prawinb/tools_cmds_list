	Press v to begin character-based visual selection (or upper case V to select whole lines, or Ctrl-v for a vertical block).
	Move the cursor to the end of the text to be cut/copied. (While selecting text, you can perform searches and other advanced movement, a feature that sets vim apart from most other editors.)
	Press d (as in "delete") to cut, or y (as in "yank", which I imagine meaning "yank so hard and fast that it leaves a copy behind") to copy.
	Move the cursor to the desired paste location.
	Press p to paste after the cursor, or P to paste before.

---> To delete line which contails(which doesn't contains) a pattern

	For example, to delete all lines containing "profile" (remove the /d to show the lines that the command will delete):
		:g/profile/d
	More complex patterns can be used, such as deleting all lines that are empty or that contain only whitespace:
		:g/^\s*$/d
	To delete all lines that do not contain a pattern, use g!, like this command to delete all lines that are not comment lines in a Vim script:
		:g!/^\s*"/d
	Note that g! is equivalent to v, so you could also do the above with:
		:v/^\s*"/d
	The next example shows use of \| ("or") to delete all lines except those that contain "error" or "warn" or "fail" (:help pattern):
		:v/error\|warn\|fail/d

	(or)
	find . -name "*.[ch]" -print | xargs ctags -a  /* working fine */

 GIT TIPS
 
 git pull probelm
	delete the HASH value in this file
	vi .git/shallow
	
To show what revision and author last modified each line of a file:
git blame filename

git remote update --prune (to update git)

git push origin local_branch:remote_branch
git push origin broot_qaq/01:proposed/praveenb/rtc_driver_xlp2xx_qaq01
git push origin gcc_492:proposed/praveenb/gcc_492

git status . --untracked-files=no
git add drivers/rtc/rtc-xlp.c
git commit
git log
git rebase -i HEAD~2
git show --name-only commit-id
git show --name-only 065d88c6f487890ea2120b742907ee987289feaa
git blame file (to check line by line authors)
git diff HEAD (diff with new files, git add new file and take git diff)

TO modify existing comment/commit (add chenges along with old changes)
git commit --amend
  First git add list-of-modified-files.
  git commit --amend

TO apply a commit from other branch do git cherry-pic
git cherry-pick <commit-id>

to apply patch:
first check patch can be applied or not
git apply --check <path_to_patch>
git apply

git commit only specific files:
git commit <file-name1> <file-name2>

and two ammend to 2nd previous commit
made changees to files
commit those changes in one/more commits
do git rebase -i HEAD~2
use oprions f or other options to merge changes to particular commit

TO create a git tag:
git tag -a <tag_name> -m "tag message/commit description"
git show <tag_name>
git push origin <tag_name>
git push origin --tags      /* TO push all local tags in signle push */

TO remove tags
git push origin :tagname (OR) git push --delete origin tagname
git tag --delete tagname /* TO delete local tag */
	
search across all the branches
git for-each-ref --format='%(*refname)' | xargs git grep "search_word"

sort branches by date of last commiit
for branch in `git branch -a | grep mladhe`;do echo -e `git show --format="%ai %ar by %an" $branch  | head -n 1` \\t$branch; done | sort -r

get the list of branches which contain the specified commit
git branch -r --contains <commit>

git command to checkout the particular commit-id
git checkout -b <new-branch-name> <commit-id>

Before do git commit commit search for these with vim
1. \s\+\n             (space and end of line trailing spaces)
2. \/\*\(\S\)         (comment and word without space)
3. \(\S\)\s\s\+\(\S\) (multiple spaces between words)
4. \(\S\)\t\+\(\S\)   (tab spaces between words)
5 \/\*\s\(\S\)\+\n  (check for wrong mutliline comments)
6 \/\*\ \([^*]\)\+\n  (check for wrong mutliline comments)

==============================================================
TO siwtch between buffers windows and tabs:
----------------------------------------
To go to particular buffer in vim:
:buffers or :ls /* to get list of buffers */
<buffer no> ctrl + ^
or :buf <buffer no>
---------------------------------------
To switch tabs in vim:
<tab no> gt
--------------------------------------
TO switch windows in screen command
ctrl + a then window number
or ctrl + a + '
or ctrl + a + "
--------------------------------------
TO switch between the vim vietical or horizonatl split
ctrl +w ->
ctrl + w <-
to split the screen virtically ctrl + w + v
or run this command :vsp
--------------------------------------------------------

:scriptnames list all the .vim files that Vim loaded for you, including your .vimrc file.

grep excluding binary files
--------------------------------------------------------
grep -I string

p4 steps:
----------------------------------------------------
login:
p4 login
to get p4 client info
  p4 client
to create a new client
  p4 <client-name> client
to use specific client
  p4 -c <client-name> <p4-command>
  or 
  p4 set P4CLIENT=client1
  p4 sync
  

to revert all unchanged files
	p4 revert -a
to revert all files
	p4 revert //...
	
To store the diff and apply patch
-----------------------------------------------------------
p4 diff -du > diff.txt
patch < diff.txt (patch -p (no of '\' es up to current directory) < diff.txt)
eg: current directory L7
//depot/trunk/L7/verifier/file.txt (/1/2/3/4 4th is L7)
current direcory location is 4 so patch -p 4 < diff.txt

patch -p 1 --dry-run < patch_file
It will not apply the patch and check for patch errors.

p4 sync to particular version
p4 sync //depot/...@126

To cpy or delete no of line without knowing number of line 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Type mk to mark this spot as k.
    Go to the end of the section you want to yank using whatever movement commands you like.
    Type: y'k (<y-yank>, <single quote-go to mark>, k) To yank from the mark to the current location.
    You can paste those lines wherever you want with p 

Similarly, d'k will cut/delete the lines from the current location to the mark. 

TO get xterm from bsub
------------------------------------------------------------------------
set DISPLAY variable "export DISPLAY="cx86-ban-06:21.0"
	to get the ip address (21.0)
		firstt open a new terminal run echo $DISPLAY (in tch shell it self)
then give bsub -Ip xterm
then it will open a terminal with new sheel

To start a gdb debugging session in emacs:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

¨      Start emacs without specifying a file

o       Unix Prompt >emacs

o       ESC-x  (then hit return)

¨      Start gdb

o       gdb (it will follow the M-x, which remains on the emacs command line)

¨      You will then be prompted by the phrase run like this? Add the file to debug (or use the file command after gdb starts)

The gdb environment will appear inside the single emacs window.
to kill the emacs press (Esc then CNTRL+x) type kill-emacs (or) ctrl+x ctrl+c

tr command
echo "abbbbcddd" | tr -s bd

TFTP Server Install and Setup
================================
Install following packages.
  sudo apt-get install xinetd tftpd tftp
Create /etc/xinetd.d/tftp and put this entry
    service tftp
    {
    protocol        = udp
    port            = 69
    socket_type     = dgram
    wait            = yes
    user            = nobody
    server          = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
    server_args     = /tftpboot
    disable         = no
    }
Create a folder /tftpboot this should match whatever you gave in server_args. mostly it will be tftpboot
   sudo mkdir /tftpboot
   sudo chmod -R 777 /tftpboot
   sudo chown -R nobody /tftpboot
Restart the xinetd service.
   sudo service xinetd restart
Now our tftp server is up and running.
Testing our tftp server
   Create a file named test with some content in /tftpboot path of the tftp server
   Obtain the ip address of the tftp server using ifconfig command
   Now in some other system follow the following steps.
    tftp 192.168.1.2
    tftp> get test
    Sent 159 bytes in 0.0 seconds
    tftp> quit
    cat test

Linux checkpatch script for code indendation

Bitbake commands:
===================================
bitbake <image>	Bake an image (add -k to continue building even errors are found in the tasks execution)
bitbake <package> -c <task>	 Execute a particular package's task. Default Tasks names: fetch, unpack, patch, configure, compile, install, package, package_write, and build.
                             Example: To (force) compiling a kernel and then build, type:
                             $ bitbake  linux-imx -f -c compile
                             $ bitbake linux-imx
Example: To show all packages included on fsl-image-gui
bitbake <image > -g -u depexp  Show the package dependency for image.
                               $ bitbake fsl-image-gui -g -u depexp
                               NOTE: This command will open a UI window, so it must be execute on a console inside the host machine (either virtual or native).
bitbake <package> -c  devshell	Open a new shell where with neccesary system values already defined for package
hob	bitbake frontend/GUI.
bitbake <package> -c listtasks	List all tasks for package
bitbake virtual/kernel -c menuconfig   Interactive kernel configuration
bitbake <image> -c fetchall	Fetch sources for a particular image
bitbake-layers show-layers  --> Show layers
bitbake-layers show-recipes "*-image-*"	Show possible images to bake. Without "*-images-*", it shows ALL recipes
bitbake -g <image> && cat pn-depends.dot | grep -v -e '-native' | grep -v digraph | grep -v -e '-image' | awk '{print $1}' | sort 
bitbake -g <pkg> && cat pn-depends.dot | grep -v -e '-native' | grep -v digraph | grep -v -e '-image' | awk '{print $1}' | sort
bitbake –v <image> 2>&1 | tee image_build.log 	Print (on console) and store verbose baking
bitbake -s | grep <pkg>	Check if certain package is present on current Yocto Setup

NOTE: Resolving any missing task queue dependencies
NOTE: PN build list saved to 'pn-buildlist'
NOTE: Task dependencies saved to 'task-depends.dot'
NOTE: Flatened recipe dependencies saved to 'recipe-depends.dot'
