Reading and trying to understand the Vulcan micro
architecture document.
Mostly they covered on hardware related
information not able to understand fully.
Ran perf numbers on xlp9xx board
Ran http_grammar with pacp_demo and demo on xlp9xx @
1.4GHz

1.Ran daily regression tests with dpi_model with Vulcan board type
Debugged failed tests.
2.Fixed issues in compiler code for vulcan 
Unsupported negative regex rules for Vulcan mini-engine.
Eg:          Abc.*(?^def)xyz
Unsupported if  zero length parts found in dot start rules.
Eg:          ^.*abcd
Drop zero length rules while converting to string rules.
3.Stared reading Vulcan micro architecture document.
New Modules in vulcan other than mini-engine
1.Rings, DRU - Descriptor Ring Unit
2.Ring station module
Handles communication among rings , ring to slice and slice to ring
Slice is a (one Big engine or mini-engine cluster)
3.ReDrive logic (presents in both Big engine and Mini-engine)
Handles communication among rings, DRU, BIU (Bus interface unit) 
Changes in FD (Flow
Descriptor).

And following are my
understanding from the document

a.There is no common module or device connected to Big engine and
Mini-engine. They are treated as separate devices.

b. Software has to send packets to their respective device (either
Big-Engine or Mini-Engine) based on flow and group_id.

1. Unrolling the quantifier body (if quantifier body has dot star or
split count more than 1) to make the dot star as top level
So that stitcher can assign token and token programs for each part.
2. Started working on analyzing rule info for nested quantifier rules
(dot star inside a quantifier body)
Eg: abc(def.*pqr.*xyz){2}lmn
For each part  rule info like byte count , alpha count, split count has to
collect.
With this rule info, weather rule is mini-engine computable or not can be
decided.

Now different kind of dot star rules will be supported by mini-engine
Eg: 
1. ab(cd.*ef){2}gh
2. ab(cd|ef){2}.*gh
3. ab(cd{2,3}e){2}.*gh

NEC/RADISYS

.         Analyzed the UBIFS issue in depth and found that the error is
due to bit flips in empty pages which should not happen.

We believe this is due to the property of the particular NAND only since
Software is not writing anything to empty pages.

Communicated our findings to Radisys in a conference call.

.         Reviewed and gave feedback to Radisys who has implemented a
workaround in UBIFS to handle the issue.

o	xloader DDR DRAM initialization and bar setup for multi-node
verified.
o	u-boot PCIe enumeration on multi-node verified.
o	ICI speed change
o	Received code for recommended register programming and sequence

o	Porting it to xloader.
*	Secure Boot:
o	QA testing ongoing (on GVP1, 2 and 3)
o	Added fuse tool usage print out
o	Debug matched with disabled key, soft-fuse overwritten hard fuse
value, no software change need.
o	Notice size issue when including Secure Boot function in x-loader;
it goes to 135K+ which requires disabling some drivers (e.g. flash device)
in order to meet the system limitation.  The x-loader requires rework for
better shape.
*	DDR DRAM
o	Investigated 1066Mhz DIMM failure and found it is related to
RDIMM.
o	Made a fix (prelaunch etc) such that single DIMM can pass
consistently. 
o	There are still issues with multiple-DIMM case which needs to be
looked at.
o	With soldered board, verified that all channels work with 666Mhz
frequency DIMMs.
o	Only single DIMM is verified to work on all slots of the soldered
board. With multiple DIMMs, observed issues with even with 666Mhz.
*	Command Center: Supporting the Post-SI with MBIST script.
o	The python script Post-SI uses is a highly convoluted with many
basic python scripts putting together and iterates thousands of times.
o	The script itself runs successfully with the first iteration, but
fails after.  Each basic script runs just fine as expected.
o	It looks like a timing issue; requested FDT team to provide
Post-SI some recommendation of required timing and sequence for better
timing.
o	Also, trying to add some delay into the ready-bit polling
mechanism for the occasions that ready-bit not being set by HW after
issuing a read command.
o	The debugging is on-going (follow-up meeting with Post-SI and DFT
later today).
*	Interlaken: The Cortina board which uses CS3  is not responding to
read/write requests. Amar looking into it. No update from HW.
*	FMN: Working on cop2 save/restore between Userspace and Linux
Kernel

instructions 

     if  field  is  quantified with variable or fixed quantifier and that
filed consist only one character 

    then it has to use match count instruction instead of stack push and

o    Fixed jira issue EPSW-798
<http://engjira.sj.broadcom.com/browse/EPSW-798>  to mark ambiguous
grammar if  filed not disambiguated and a variable quantified field
presents 

 

o   Fixed one more issue if more than 8 fixed quantifiers used for tokens
compiler generating stack and loopnz instruction 

Modified this to use unroll count 

 

                Sent these code changes for review

                Today I worked on random normalizer program

                And attended training sessions 

                                Morning session was just about
introduction

                                Evening session is on git 

                                In this I learnt about

                                                -git clone  -- clones the
data from remote server to local 

                                                -git branch - create new
branch

                                                -git merge  -- merge will
make it the commit to form like a branch

                                                -git rebase - rebase will
make it like linear structure

                                                -git update -update the
new branches 

                                                -git pull - update the
current branch too

                                                -git push  -- to push the
commits 

 

Thanks,

Hi Kumaravel,

                

                Today I worked on random normalizer program

                For this program I have written 6 transducer programs

1.       converting one character to its next character  eg : a --> b , c
- ->d

2.       converting three consecutive  character to single character eg:
ccc --> c

3.       change lower case to upper case eg : ab[cd]-->abCD (changes the
case for  characters which are in side this [ ] )

4.       removes the duplicates eg  cccccc-->c

5.       prints the next character for every character in whole string eg
: abcd --> bcde

6.       changes the integers to string format eg: 1-->one

also

I have attached the c file which consists the random normalizer program

 

Thanks,

Praveen B
